"""Refuse control characters and carriage returns in tracked text files.

Two defect classes, both of which this repository has actually shipped, and both of which
are invisible to review because the damage is a byte rather than a word.

1. A LONE CONTROL BYTE, from a backslash collapsing in transport. `~/AGENTS.md` sec.14
   records the mechanism: a double backslash in a command handed to an agent's shell
   arrives as a single one, so `usr\\bin` in the intended text becomes `usr` + 0x08, and
   `%APPDATA%\\nushell\\autoload` becomes `%APPDATA%` + a real newline + `ushell` + 0x07.
   retch carried two: `templates/justfile-common.just` had `usr\\bin` as `usr` + 0x08, and
   `crates/sysinfo/src/win_setupapi.rs` had the Win32 device path `\\\\?\\acpi#...`
   as `\\?` + 0x07 + `cpi#` -- TWO collapses on one line, since the doubled backslash lost
   one AND `\\a` became BEL. That one sat in a `///` doc comment, so it shipped to docs.rs.

   The danger is not cosmetic. Whatever consumes the text next reads the surviving single
   backslash as an escape, so the same collapse has previously written a non-comment line
   into a nushell config and aborted the rest of the file.

2. A CARRIAGE RETURN. `.gitattributes` pins `* text=auto eol=lf` because this tree is
   Syncthing-shared across Linux, macOS and Windows. A CRLF worktree copy is therefore
   always drift, and `git status` CANNOT report it -- with the attribute set git treats the
   two as equivalent, so the file reads as clean while every tool that opens the worktree
   (chezmoi, python, a shell) sees the CRs. The sibling repo `etr` shipped exactly this:
   `scripts/install_man.py` sat CRLF in the worktree while its committed blob was LF and
   byte-identical to the two repos it is vendored from.

   NOTE: retch's own `WIP.md` is uniformly CRLF and that is deliberate and recorded -- it is
   gitignored, so `git ls-files` never offers it here and this guard cannot reach it. Do not
   "normalise" that file.

WHY THIS IS A CHECK AND NOT A CONVENTION: every instance above was found by reading bytes,
never by reading the file. A guard is the only thing that looks.

DO NOT BUILD THIS OUT OF `grep`. `grep -c $'\\r'` from an agent shell is the subject of
`~/AGENTS.md` sec.17 -- the pattern collapses to empty, `grep` matches every line, and the
answer that comes back is the file's LINE COUNT wearing a carriage-return costume. It is
wrong in both directions, and the tell is that it equals `wc -l`. Count bytes in a language
that has them.
