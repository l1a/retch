          "message": "Restart the benchmark dashboard, charted by version (#278)\n\nThe published history mixes things that cannot be compared: until\nv0.19.0 the fastfetch series measured the wrong workload (built-in\ndefault, no config, every module, or a personal config), the retch\nseries span a mode redefinition (cpu-usage left the default mode),\nlocal points carry no power state, and CI kept only 50 runs, 12 of\nthem with CLI timings. It is archived on gh-pages under\ndev/bench/archive/ with a note on what is comparable, and the\ndashboard starts again from this merge.\n\n- scripts/bench_meta.py stamps every CLI point's `extra` with the\n  version, plus AC or battery for local runs (on arrakis the power\n  state moved --short by ~0.3 ms). parse_criterion.py (CI) and\n  upload_local_bench.py (local) both use it; both self-tests check it.\n- benches/dashboard/ is our own chart page: points labelled by version,\n  and retch time divided by fastfetch time per mode from the same run,\n  which cancels CI runner speed (macOS CI's retch default alone ranged\n  334-2596 ms). Battery runs are drawn as triangles. model.js is tested\n  under Node by model.test.js in `just bench-check`; `just bench-page`\n  publishes the page (asks first).\n- History caps go from 50 (CI) and 100 (local) to 200 runs per suite;\n  the cap deletes older entries from data.js, not just from the chart.\n\nAssisted-By: Claude Opus 5.5",
